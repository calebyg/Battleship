## About Game
Battleship is a classic two-player game that involves players choosing coordinates on a grid to attack their opponent's fleet.
A game of Battleship is expected to have a variety of different ships for both players to place on their grid. The game continues
until a player has sunk all ten of the opponent's ships.

## Why I made this
I wrote this program because I like the game's concepts and wanted to fulfill the rules by making a simple application.
